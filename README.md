UnmanagedPowerShell
===================

Totally imported from the original code at https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell, I only changed the powershell runner to be an interactive shell.

Moreover, I added a compressed version of PowerView, PowerUp, PowerUpSQL, Powermad to the runner, more scripts can be added similarly.

The main purpose of this is to make Sliver c2 framework runs unmanaged powershell that bypasses Applocker and application whitelisting.
